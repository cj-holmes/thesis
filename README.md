Repository of LaTeX code for the production of my PhD thesis titled **Surface alignment control of nematodynamics**

After minor corrections, this thesis was accepted and published on the Open Research Exeter (ORE) platform, found at <https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10036/4009>.

**I am now uploading this folder approximately eight years after original submission. As such, I have had to make changes and tweaks to the LaTeX files in order to get it to compile. This repositiory contains, and may also continue to contain, further voluntary corrections/formatting changes to the original publication.**
