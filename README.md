# APS style thesis <img src="figures/crest.jpg" align="right" width = 120px/>

This is a WIP branch.
An attempt at converting my thesis with the revtex4-1 package to make it look like an American Physical Society paper (a very pretty and dense two column format)

It has worked...mostly. **There are still some warnings that I need to debug...**
