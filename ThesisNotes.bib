@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="The notation adopted here is the notation used by Miesowicz, but some texts adopt the Helfrich notation \cite {Helfrich1969a} which interchanges the above definitions of $\eta _1$ and $\eta _2$."}

Stewart \cite {Stewart2004}, which gives a comprehensive mathematical introduction to the dynamic theory of nematic liquid crystals."}

@FOOTNOTE{Note13,key="Note13",note="Note that here we are plotting the average azimuthal distortion, and as such, the curve will never fully reach $\phi =0^{\circ }$ due to the thin layers at the surfaces of the cell retaining their initial alignment angle. However, at very high flow rates, the vast majority of the cell has rotated towards $\phi =0^{\circ }$."}

@FOOTNOTE{Note20,key="Note20",note="The difference in the 0 $\mu L/h$ capture between Figure \ref {fig:splay_with_data} (a) and Figure \ref {fig:splay_against_data} (a) is due to the experimental difficulty in rotating the cell so that flow could be applied in the opposite direction. In doing so, the area of the cell being sampled has changed, with variations in cell thickness causing the dark fringes to move."}

This has involved the setting of electrical wire in Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (a silicon based organic polymer) and drawing it out to leave a smooth flow channel behind. A common problem here is that the PDMS does not always cure hard and can expand and contract when pressure is applied."}
