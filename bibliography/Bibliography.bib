	Abstract = {While we are all familiar with liquid crystal displays, an industry currently worth more than US dollars 60 billion yr(-1) and growing rapidly, fewer people are aware of the breadth of the subject of liquid crystals--one that represents the study of the fourth state of matter. Liquid crystals are found as essential elements in biological systems, soaps and detergents, sensor technologies and in the manipulation of electromagnetic radiation of various wavelengths. This meeting was designed to highlight both the truly multidisciplinary nature of liquid crystal science and to feature those areas away from electro-optic displays; these issues are developed and summarized in more detail.},

@article{Gleeson2006,
	Abstract = {Laser trapping of particles in three dimensions can occur as a result of the refraction of strongly focused light through micrometre-sized particles. The use of this effect to produce laser tweezers is extremely common in fields such as biology, but it is only relatively recently that the technique has been applied to liquid crystals (LCs). The possibilities are exciting: droplets of LCs can be trapped, moved and rotated in an isotropic fluid medium, or both particles and defects can be trapped and manipulated within a liquid crystalline medium. This paper considers both the possibilities. The mechanism of transfer of optical angular momentum from circularly polarized light to small droplets of nematic LCs is described. Further, it is shown that droplets of chiral LCs can be made to rotate when illuminated with linearly polarized light and possible mechanisms are discussed. The trapping and manipulation of micrometre-sized particles in an aligned LC medium is used to provide a measure of local shear viscosity coefficients and a unique test of theory at low Ericksen number in LCs.},

@article{Jewell2005,
	Abstract = {The dielectric anisotropy of a highly dispersive dual-frequency nematic liquid crystal (MDA-00-3969 (Merck KGa)) has been determined using the optical fully-leaky guided-mode technique. A 4Vrms sinusoidal voltage was applied across a 5microm hybrid aligned nematic (HAN) cell at various frequencies in both the positive and negative dielectric anisotropy regime. Optical data was collected at each frequency enabling the director profile in each case to be determined using a multi-layer optics model in combination with a liquid crystal free-energy minimization routine. The thresholdless response of the HAN cell combined with the extreme sensitivity of the optical characterization technique has allowed subtle changes in dielectric permittivity with frequency to be observed. The resulting measured dispersion shows excellent agreement with a single Debye-type relaxation model.},

@article{Yang2007b,
	Abstract = {Using both direct mathematical analysis and numerical modeling based on the predictions by Jones [1] it is shown that if the director in a liquid crystal cell is in a plane which lies at 45 degrees to the incident polarization, then, for normally incident light, the transmission signal which conserves polarization will always have a phase difference of pi/2 from the transmission signal of the orthogonal polarization. This is independent of the director profile in the plane, the cell thickness, the anisotropy of the liquid crystal refractive index and the optical parameters of other isotropic layers in the cell. Based on this realization a hybrid aligned nematic liquid crystal cell has been tested as a thresholdless voltage-controlled polarization rotator. By using a quarter-wave plate to compensate for the phase difference between the two orthogonal output polarizations a simple liquid crystal spatial light modulator has been realized.},
