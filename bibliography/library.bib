@article{Shah2001,
abstract = {The competitive binding of a molecule forming a liquid crystal and a targeted analyte to a common molecular receptor presented at a solid surface possessing nanometer-scale topography is used to trigger an easily visualized surface-driven change in the orientation of a micrometer-thick film of liquid crystal. Diffusion of the targeted analyte from atmosphere to surface-immobilized receptor across the micrometer-thick film of liquid crystal is fast (on the order of seconds), and the competitive interaction of the targeted analyte and liquid crystal with the receptor provides a high level of tolerance to nontargeted species (water, ethanol, acetone, and hexanes). Systems that provide parts-per-billion (by volume) sensitivity to either organoamine or organophosphorus compounds are demonstrated, and their use for imaging of spatial gradients in concentration is reported. This approach does not require complex instrumentation and could provide the basis of wearable personalized sensors for measurement of real-time and cumulative exposure to environmental agents.},

@article{Vanapalli2009,
abstract = {We integrate a sensitive microfluidic comparator into a T-junction device and report measurements of the excess pressure drop due to a single moving droplet confined in a rectangular microchannel. We specifically focus on drops that are not coated with surfactants and study the effects of drop size, droplet viscosity and capillary number on their hydrodynamic resistance. In the capillary number range of approximately 10(-3)-10(-2), we find two distinct regimes for hydrodynamic resistance behavior based on drop size. In regime I associated with small drops (drop length/channel width approximately <4), we find that the pressure drop is independent of the drop size and the capillary number, and depends weakly on the ratio of the viscosities of the two immiscible phases. In regime II, associated with large drops (drop length/channel width > approximately 4), depending on the viscosity ratio of the two phases, the hydrodynamic resistance could increase, decrease or remain unchanged with drop size. We present a simple model that qualitatively captures these experimental trends. This model reveals that the pressure drop in regime I is dominated by the dissipation due to the end caps, and in regime II by both the end caps and the central body of the droplet. Such fundamental understanding will enable the design of large-scale energy-efficient fluidic circuits by minimizing the overall pressure drop in a network and may also provide insights into controlling droplet traffic to build functional passively-driven two-phase microfluidic technologies.},

abstract = {Thin liquid films, such as soap bubbles, have been studied extensively for over a century because they are easily formed and mediate a wide range of transport processes in physics, chemistry and engineering. When a bubble on a liquid-gas or solid-gas interface (referred to herein as an interfacial bubble) ruptures, the general expectation is that the bubble vanishes. More precisely, the ruptured thin film is expected to retract rapidly until it becomes part of the interface, an event that typically occurs within milliseconds. The assumption that ruptured bubbles vanish is central to theories on foam evolution and relevant to health and climate because bubble rupture is a source for aerosol droplets. Here we show that for a large range of fluid parameters, interfacial bubbles can create numerous small bubbles when they rupture, rather than vanishing. We demonstrate, both experimentally and numerically, that the curved film of the ruptured bubble can fold and entrap air as it retracts. The resulting toroidal geometry of the trapped air is unstable, leading to the creation of a ring of smaller bubbles. The higher pressure associated with the higher curvature of the smaller bubbles increases the absorption of gas into the liquid, and increases the efficiency of rupture-induced aerosol dispersal.},

@article{Yang2007b,
abstract = {Using both direct mathematical analysis and numerical modeling based on the predictions by Jones [1] it is shown that if the director in a liquid crystal cell is in a plane which lies at 45 degrees to the incident polarization, then, for normally incident light, the transmission signal which conserves polarization will always have a phase difference of pi/2 from the transmission signal of the orthogonal polarization. This is independent of the director profile in the plane, the cell thickness, the anisotropy of the liquid crystal refractive index and the optical parameters of other isotropic layers in the cell. Based on this realization a hybrid aligned nematic liquid crystal cell has been tested as a thresholdless voltage-controlled polarization rotator. By using a quarter-wave plate to compensate for the phase difference between the two orthogonal output polarizations a simple liquid crystal spatial light modulator has been realized.},

abstract = {The dielectric anisotropy of a highly dispersive dual-frequency nematic liquid crystal (MDA-00-3969 (Merck KGa)) has been determined using the optical fully-leaky guided-mode technique. A 4Vrms sinusoidal voltage was applied across a 5microm hybrid aligned nematic (HAN) cell at various frequencies in both the positive and negative dielectric anisotropy regime. Optical data was collected at each frequency enabling the director profile in each case to be determined using a multi-layer optics model in combination with a liquid crystal free-energy minimization routine. The thresholdless response of the HAN cell combined with the extreme sensitivity of the optical characterization technique has allowed subtle changes in dielectric permittivity with frequency to be observed. The resulting measured dispersion shows excellent agreement with a single Debye-type relaxation model.},

abstract = {The pretilt angles of liquid crystal molecules can be controlled by using conventional polyimide (PI) alignment material doped with different concentrations of Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsequioxanes (POSS) nanoparticles, which have been observed to spontaneously induce vertical alignment. The addition of POSS in the homogenous PI changes the surface energy of the alignment layer and generates a variable pretilt angle. Experimental results demonstrate that the pretilt angle thetap is a function of the POSS concentration, and can be tuned continuously over the range of 0 degrees <thetap<90 degrees. The polar anchoring energy of POSS/PI alignment layer is almost constant regardless of the POSS concentration. This technique is very simple and is compatible with methods familiar in the current LCD industry.},

@article{Grigorenko2005,
abstract = {A great deal of attention has recently been focused on a new class of smart materials--so-called left-handed media--that exhibit highly unusual electromagnetic properties and promise new device applications. Left-handed materials require negative permeability micro, an extreme condition that has so far been achieved only for frequencies in the microwave to terahertz range. Extension of the approach described in ref. 7 to achieve the necessary high-frequency magnetic response in visible optics presents a formidable challenge, as no material--natural or artificial--is known to exhibit any magnetism at these frequencies. Here we report a nanofabricated medium consisting of electromagnetically coupled pairs of gold dots with geometry carefully designed at a 10-nm level. The medium exhibits a strong magnetic response at visible-light frequencies, including a band with negative micro. The magnetism arises owing to the excitation of an antisymmetric plasmon resonance. The high-frequency permeability qualitatively reveals itself via optical impedance matching. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering magnetism at visible frequencies and pave the way towards magnetic and left-handed components for visible optics.},

@article{Vollrath2001,
abstract = {Spider silk has outstanding mechanical properties despite being spun at close to ambient temperatures and pressures using water as the solvent. The spider achieves this feat of benign fibre processing by judiciously controlling the folding and crystallization of the main protein constituents, and by adding auxiliary compounds, to create a composite material of defined hierarchical structure. Because the 'spinning dope' (the material from which silk is spun) is liquid crystalline, spiders can draw it during extrusion into a hardened fibre using minimal forces. This process involves an unusual internal drawdown within the spider's spinneret that is not seen in industrial fibre processing, followed by a conventional external drawdown after the dope has left the spinneret. Successful copying of the spider's internal processing and precise control over protein folding, combined with knowledge of the gene sequences of its spinning dopes, could permit industrial production of silk-based fibres with unique properties under benign conditions.},

Lasing is observed at densities more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than previously demonstrated or theoretically predicted, assuming a uniform nanocrystal quantum dot distribution. Charged droplets, between 10 and 40 microm in size, are electrodynamically levitated and optically pumped. Substantial laser signals at low thresholds are measured from the directional emission normal to the pump beam, owing to the high Q cavity modes.},

@article{Gleeson2006a,
abstract = {Laser trapping of particles in three dimensions can occur as a result of the refraction of strongly focused light through micrometre-sized particles. The use of this effect to produce laser tweezers is extremely common in fields such as biology, but it is only relatively recently that the technique has been applied to liquid crystals (LCs). The possibilities are exciting: droplets of LCs can be trapped, moved and rotated in an isotropic fluid medium, or both particles and defects can be trapped and manipulated within a liquid crystalline medium. This paper considers both the possibilities. The mechanism of transfer of optical angular momentum from circularly polarized light to small droplets of nematic LCs is described. Further, it is shown that droplets of chiral LCs can be made to rotate when illuminated with linearly polarized light and possible mechanisms are discussed. The trapping and manipulation of micrometre-sized particles in an aligned LC medium is used to provide a measure of local shear viscosity coefficients and a unique test of theory at low Ericksen number in LCs.},

abstract = {A new photoalignment method of controlling the pretilt angle of liquid crystals (LCs) by using organic/inorganic hybrid interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) is proposed and demonstrated. In the hybrid IPN alignment layer system, the competition between poly(vinyl cinnamate) (PVCi) favoring planar alignment and poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) favoring vertical alignment made it possible to achieve pretilt angle in a wide range from 0 degrees to 90 degrees, and adjust pretilt angle as a function of PDMS content. In addition, we achieved the high azimuthal anchoring energy at the intermediate pretilt angle by using PDMS as the vertical-aligning component.},

abstract = {We observed light-induced alignment of the nematic liquid crystal, 4, 4(')-n-pentylcyanobiphenyl (5CB), on a fused quartz. Irradiation of the adsorbed layer with polarized ultraviolet light produced homogeneous alignment in a 5CB-filled liquid crystal cell with the easy orientation axis perpendicular to the polarization direction. The measured anchoring energy increases with illumination up to 10(-4) erg/cm (2). Phase retardation and pretilt measurements confirmed near homogeneous alignment of the LC in a cell, while the polarization dependence of second harmonic generation suggested a near normal alignment of the adsorbed layer. We believe that light-induced rearrangement or phototransformation of the adsorbed layer causes the observed phenomenon.},

@article{Zhang2011,
abstract = {Liquid crystals playing a crucial role in material sciences show increasing potential applications in nanotechnology and industry. Generally, thermodynamic and dynamic properties of liquid crystals strongly depend on the corresponding force fields (FF); thus, it is necessary and urgent for us to establish a reliable force field for a given liquid crystal system. In this paper, we develop a new set of FF parameters for the 5CB (4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl) molecule by reoptimizing some parameters of TraPPE-UA in order to reproduce the bulk density. This strategy for the construction of 5CB FF is rather advisable as it not only provides reliable values for the Lennard-Jones parameters but also reduces the computational cost and maintains FF transferability. Indeed, our simulation results show that the phase behavior, the order parameter, conformational features, neighboring molecular pair arrangements, and diffusion properties of 5CB can be reproduced very well. We further validate the transferability of this 5CB FF by extending it to the 8CB (4-cyano-4'-octylbiphenyl) system. As a result, both the nematic and the partial bilayer smectic phases (Sm-A(d)) and the nematic-isotropic and the smectic-nematic transition temperatures as well as the diffusion properties of 8CB are successfully reproduced. Therefore, this set of FF parameters originally designed for the 5CB molecule is reliable and transferable. Its effectiveness to model nCB series and molecules with similar chemical structures is expected.},

These areas have an orientation effect on liquid crystals indistinguishable from the rubbing process, which allows a systematic investigation of the orientation properties of an alignment layer as a function of its nanometer-scale morphology. Refractive index patterns can be tailored with this method by scratching a suitable area, as demonstrated by fabrication of an optical waveguide 6 micrometers wide and 5 millimeters long.},

abstract = {Surface plasmons are electromagnetic waves that can exist at metal interfaces because of coupling between light and free electrons. Restricted to travel along the interface, these waves can be channeled, concentrated, or otherwise manipulated by surface patterning. However, because surface roughness and other inhomogeneities have so far limited surface-plasmon propagation in real plasmonic devices, simple high-throughput methods are needed to fabricate high-quality patterned metals. We combined template stripping with precisely patterned silicon substrates to obtain ultrasmooth pure metal films with grooves, bumps, pyramids, ridges, and holes. Measured surface-plasmon-propagation lengths on the resulting surfaces approach theoretical values for perfectly flat films. With the use of our method, we demonstrated structures that exhibit Raman scattering enhancements above 10(7) for sensing applications and multilayer films for optical metamaterials.},
